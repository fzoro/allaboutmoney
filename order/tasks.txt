### Features
1 - Handle the webhooks(update the order)
1.2 - Best option would be to expose main_app endpoint, redirect the call to order and then do whatever is needed(send an email for instance)
2 - Configure the main app to use allboutmoney::order.(mostly using docker-compose).

4 - Persist the events on the order collection to keep history of events.

4.1 - Create handler for the new exception(OrderConfiguration)

5 - Rewrite README.md with workflow. =D

### Tech Debts
1 - Expose data with Assembler ( https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/current/reference/html/#fundamentals.resource-assembler )
2 - Write unit tests
    2.1 - write integration tests ( with wiremock and testcontainer)
    2.2 - write smoke tests (connect to sandbox)
3 - Add tracer to entities and spring sleuth
4 - deploy as a docker container


### Fixes
Should be done at least for order. The reason is there are tokens that cannot be exposed. - Expose data with Assembler ( https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/current/reference/html/#fundamentals.resource-assembler )
